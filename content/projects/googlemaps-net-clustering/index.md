<a href="https://github.com/pootzko/GoogleMaps.Net.Clustering">C# library</a> for clustering map points. This library is very suitable for WebAPI (and similar-type) projects that don't depend on ASP.Net MVC.

This is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/kunukn/Google-Maps-Clustering-CSharp">Google Maps Server-side Clustering with C#</a>Â repo. The guys made a fast, working implementation of Google Maps clustering for C#. However, they tightly coupled it with MVC and WebForms where all I needed was a simple C# way to crunch a bunch of simple map points and convert them into cluster points.

You can download the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/GoogleMaps.Net.Clustering/">GoogleMaps.Net.Clustering</a> package to install the latest version of GoogleMaps.Net.Clustering Lib.
