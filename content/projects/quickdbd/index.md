Normally I would only put private projects to this section of theÂ site, but I'm quite proud of this one.. :)

Quick Database Diagrams (<a href="https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/">QuickDBD</a>) is a simple online tool to quickly draw database diagrams by typing. It is an internal project we've been working on in <a href="https://dovetail.ie/">Dovetail Technologies Ltd</a> where I am currently working on as a lead dev.
