In this short post I’ll explain how to write a `WHERE LIKE` clause in InfluxDB. The syntax is slightly different from what you would use in standard SQL. There is no `LIKE` clause per se and instead syntax resembles pattern matching with an equality or negation operator.

Bellow are two very simple examples. The first one returns all the records where `SensorName` starts with abcd and the second one returns all the records where `SensorName` doesn’t start with "abcd".

```sql
SELECT * FROM "sensor" WHERE SensorName =~ /abcd*/ AND time > now() - 5m
SELECT * FROM "sensor" WHERE SensorName !~ /abcd*/ AND time > now() - 5m
```

This should be enough to get you started. Cheers!
